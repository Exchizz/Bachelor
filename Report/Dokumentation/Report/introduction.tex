\subsection*{Background}
UAS is an emerging technology\footcite{gupta2013review} used in lots of different areas. They are used in military purposes since UAVs are better suited for dull, dirty, or dangerous missions than manned aircraft. They are also widely used commercially to provide images of fields, power lines, pipelines \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned\_aerial\_vehicle\#Civil}} and so forth.\\
Since UAVs, especially multiroters or quadcopters, have become less expensive to produce, a marked for civilians and hobbyists has emerged. At the moment of writing, SDU is developing \footnote{\url{http://videnskab.dk/teknologi/droner-skal-have-elektronisk-nummerplade}} a registration plate, so that it is possible to see where drones are flying and who to be held responsible when accidents occur.

\textcolor{blue}{A challenge concerning multiroters and especially multiroters is the amount of energy they are capable of carrying. A drone designed with long flytime in mind is capable of flying approximately 20 minutes depending on weather and payload. If the drone is equipped with a heavy camera or other kind of payload, then the flight time begins to decrease rapidly. So far the solution has been to increase the size of the drones to mount bigger batteries, but this might not be right way of doing it. Drones become less efficient, less responsive and gets more dangerous due to increase in weight.\\
By looking at the nature, one can see how small animals like ants and birds manage to cooperate and thereby build or move bigger things that they would not be able to do on their own. This way of small independent, decentralized units working together is called a swarm\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm\_intelligence}}.\\
By making UAVs smaller, they get more efficient, their flight time increase and they get cheaper but of the cost of their ability to lift\footcite{1_kumar_2016}. Therefore it seems like an idea to make small drones cooperate to solve more complex tasks.} \\

Many different flight pilots exists on the marked. SDU UAS has decided to use AutoQuad since the code is Open Source \footnote{Quatos, which is their control algorithm is not Open Source.} and the multiroters show reliable and steady flying. An AutoQuad multiroter delivered by ViaCopter\footnote{\url{https://viacopter.eu/}} comes with with the AutoQuad flight controller M4, Electronic Speed Controllers \footnote{Number depends of rotors on UAV} ESC32 and rotors. ViaCopter smallest drone is delivered without Electronic Speed Controllers since H-bridges are build into the M4 flight pilot.
ViaCopter delivers drones in different sizes but their flight controller is the same. This means that code developed for ViaCopters Ladybird can be deployed on a large drone and it will continue to work\footnote{Assumed the developer did not break important lowlevel tasks}

At the time of writing, SDU is collaborating with HCA airport to find anomalies in fences.\\ 
\textit{Airports are burdened by a number of required inspection tasks to maintain a high level of 
safety and security.
Some of these tasks may advantageously be performed by a drone rather than the current manual labour, and this will save significant resources.
In this project they are targeting a specific need for frequent inspection of the fence surrounding the airport shown in figure \ref{fig:hca_fence}. 
The inspection concerns fence holes or similar anomalies. We hypothesize that a drone is 
capable of unsupervised autonomous inspecting the airport fence detecting small holes down 
to a radius of 5 cm.} \footnote{Application sent to Energi Fyns Udviklingsfond which has been granted, Ansøgning 2015-01-30 Energi Fyns Udviklingsfond-1.pdf on USB}

In order to avoid flying into the fence and to fly accurate enough for the camera to film, it is required to use an RTK GPS\footcite{2_gakstatter_2014}.

In another project, SDU is working together with a company, Ecobotix, to avoid the need of pesticides in organic crops. Pesticides are used to kill pests from the crows. When using pesticides a health risks exists for those who eat the crops. The use of pesticides also reduce the amount of diversity in nature since it is also killing beneficial organisms and potentially harm other animals in the food chain like birds. If nothing is used the crops might die, and that is very expensive to the farmer. \footnote{\url{http://naturerhverv.dk/tvaergaaende/gudp/gudp-projekter/2015/oekodrone-skal-sprede-mariehoens-i-stedet-for-pesticider/} last visited 18-04-2016}\\
SDU and Ecobix use drones to spread bugs like ladybirds and gall midges, over the crops to eat pests as shown in fugure \ref{fig:organicdrone}. \\
It is required the drones fly approximately 1 meter above ground at 1.5 meter/sec. It is therefore necessary to use an RTK-GPS in order to avoid hitting the ground in case of pumps in the fields. \footnote{Jensen, K.; Larsen, R.; Laursen M.S.; Neerup, M.M.; Skriver, M. and Jørgensen, R.N. Towards UAV contour flight over agricultural fields using RTK-GNSS and a Digital Height Model. Accepted for oral presentation at CIGR-AgEng June 2016.}\\
Both projects tends to use AutoQaud to solve their tasks. The AutoQuad version available at the moment of writing only supports autonomous flying using its onboard GPS. This project extends AutoQuads functionality by making it support global positioning from an RTK-GPS.
